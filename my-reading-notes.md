### Notes from reading online

1. Netlify
   - [Monorepos](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/monorepos/)
     - Example : [UW Health Migration](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/09/20/how-uw-health-serves-dynamic-data-on-their-jamstack-site-with-netlify-and-next.js/)

   - [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/examples)

3. JAMStack
    - [What is JAMStack?](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/)
    - Modern web development architecture based on client-side **JavaScript**, reusable **APIs**, and prebuilt **Markup**
    - https://app.stackbit.com/create/theme
    - Remix, Supabase, 
4. [MACH Architecture](https://www.sitecore.com/blog/headless/what-is-mach-architecture) 
   - A set of technology principles behind new, best-of-breed technology platforms
   - **M**icroservices-based, **A**PI-first, **C**loud-native, and **H**eadless
       - **Microservices:** Individual pieces of business functionality that are independently developed, deployed and managed.
           1. **Does it feature true microservices?**
           2. **Can you execute phased roll-outs?**
           3. **Does it support a best-of-breed approach?**
       - **API-first:** All functionality is exposed through an API, making it possible to tie together two or more applications or services.
           1. **Is it built with APIs from the ground up or has it adopted an API bolt-on strategy?**
           2. **Can you access quality documentation?**
           3. **How are integrations completed?**
       - **Cloud-Native SaaS:** Software-as-a-Service that leverages the full capabilities of the cloud, beyond storage and hosting, including elastic scaling of highly available resources. Functionality is updated manually, eliminating the need for upgrade management.
           1. **Does it offer limitless scalability?**
           2. **Is the software delivered as-a-service (SaaS)?**
           3. **Do updates and upgrades happen via continuous delivery without breaking changes?**
       - **Headless:** The front-end user experience is completely decoupled from the back-end logic, allowing for complete design freedom in creating the user interface and for connecting to other channels and devices (i.e. existing applications, IoT, A/R, Vending Machines, sensors, etc.).
           1. **Can you “see” the administrative or buyer interface without development time?**
           2. **Can you develop and deploy the user experience freely and flexibly**
   - Every component is pluggable, scalable, replaceable, and can be continuously improved
